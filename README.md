# ðŸ“˜ TextAnalyzer Toolkit

**TextAnalyzer** is a Python project that evolves with each chapter of a data structures and algorithms textbook. As new concepts are introducedâ€”like recursion, linked lists, trees, and Huffman encodingâ€”theyâ€™re integrated into the toolkit. By the end, the project becomes a full-featured text analysis and compression engine.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Reinforce DSA concepts through hands-on implementation.
- Build reusable, well-structured, and efficient Python modules.
- Create a real-world tool that gets smarter as you learn.
